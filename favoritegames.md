# My Favorite Games

I enjoy video games, so here are a few of my favorite games:

1. **"Call of Duty"** 
   - A first person shooter.

2. **"Grand Theft Auto V"** 
   - An open world free roam game that follows the lives of three characters.

3. **"NBA 2K24"** 
   - A basketball simulation game. You can play as real NBA teams and players or create your own.

Are you familiar with any of these titles?
